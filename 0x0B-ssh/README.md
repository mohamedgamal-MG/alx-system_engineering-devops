## Project Overview

In this project, you'll work with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server located in a distant datacenter. You'll connect to the server using SSH and an RSA key pair. The primary objectives of the project include understanding servers, SSH, creating RSA key pairs, and secure remote access.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll be able to:

- Define the concept of a server and identify common server locations.
- Explain SSH (Secure Shell) and its role in secure communication.
- Generate an SSH RSA key pair for authentication purposes.
- Establish a secure connection to a remote host using the SSH RSA key pair.
- Differentiate between `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `/bin/bash` in script shebangs.

## Instructions

1. Familiarize yourself with the provided resources to gain insights into servers, SSH, and RSA key pairs.
2. Retrieve your Ubuntu server information from the "My Servers" section of the intranet.
3. Use SSH to connect to the remote server using your provided/created RSA key pair.
4. Execute tasks and challenges specified in the project description.
5. Adhere to security best practices while working on the remote server.

## Submission

1. Ensure all your Bash script files are marked as executable.
2. Incorporate `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as the shebang at the beginning of your Bash scripts.
3. Demonstrate your understanding of SSH, RSA keys, and secure remote access practices.

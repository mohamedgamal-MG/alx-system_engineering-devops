## Background

During my time at SlideShare, I was involved in developing an auto-remediation tool named Skynet. This tool monitored, scaled, and fixed cloud infrastructure using Puppet. One incident highlighted the power of configuration management: a bug in the code resulted in shutting down a significant portion of our conversion infrastructure. Thanks to Puppet, we were able to swiftly recover and restore normal operation.
